Pizza (Italian: ['pittsa], Neapolitan: ['pittse]) is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, 
flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other 
ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.),
 which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
 [1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.
 A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

Pizza is a popular Italian dish consisting of a leavened, flattened disk of bread dough topped with sauce, cheese, and various 
other ingredients, then baked at a high temperature.Originating in Naples, Italy, as a humble dish for the poor in the 18th century, 
it evolved from ancient flatbread traditions and became a worldwide favorite after American soldiers in World War II discovered it in Italy. 
A classic example is the Margherita, topped with tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil, inspired by Queen Margherita of Savoy.
